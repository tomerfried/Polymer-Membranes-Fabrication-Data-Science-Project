A project which seeks to answer the factors for the symmetry of polymer membranes.

Its main pillars are:
- Image processing for the recognition of pores on the images of the membranes
- Creation and pre-processing of a dataset, from crude metadata of images of the membranes
- Implementation of a Deep Learning model on the dataset and explanatory analysis of the predictions

The project was done in Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon institute in Germany, guided by Dr. Martin Held and Dr. Roland Aydin

Images of membranes,the dataset and the results were not uploaded due to copyright infringement
